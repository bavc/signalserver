# signalserver

SignalServer is intended to become a web app to accompany [QCTools](https://github.com/bavc/qctools). Some early planning documentation is available in this [Vision doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zXtVf47LVEYJvc9nPbLY-0pTDouyyNlsbeFu1YdmMlI/edit?usp=sharing).

To test out signalserver, `clone` this repository, `cd` into the directory, and run `./quickstart` in your Terminal window. You may need to install some dependencies, such as Python and Docker, to get it running.
